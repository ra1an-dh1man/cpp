You are developing a currency converter application for an international finance company. The application is designed to convert an amount of money from USD (United States Dollar) to the desired target currency using a specific exchange rate. The application uses dynamic memory allocation with the new and delete operators to handle exchange rates.

The first line contains the exchange rate.
The second line contains the amount in USD.

#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>
using namespace std;

class Converter
{
    public:
    
    float ex;
    float dlr;
    
    Converter(float ex, float dlr)
    {
        this->ex=ex;
        this->dlr=dlr;
    }
    float show()
    {
        float num=ex*dlr;
        cout<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<ex*dlr;
    }
};

int main()
{
    float ex,dlr;
    cin>>ex>>dlr;
    Converter* obj= new Converter(ex, dlr);
    obj->show();
    
    delete obj;
    return 0;
}
